A recent [BMJ Oncology paper](https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049) reported that "Global incidence of early-onset cancer increased by 79.1% and the number of early-onset cancer deaths increased by 27.7% between 1990 and 2019.".

Those are stagering numbers, so let's take a look at how they make their calculations.


## Incidence

In page 3, they state: "In 2019, the incidence number of early-onset cancer was 3.26 million, a 79.1% increase from 1990".

So, they are using the absolute number of early-onset cancers in 2019 (`r prettyNum(incidencia_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) and comparing it with the 1999 number (`r prettyNum(incidencia_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`).

If you calculate the increase, it really gives you a `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1)(incidencia_2019/incidencia_99 - 1)` = `r prettyNum(incidencia_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` / `r prettyNum(incidencia_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`.

## Deaths

Also in page 3: "Besides, the number of early-onset cancer deaths in 2019 was 1.06 million, which was an increase of 27.7% from 1990".

Again, they are using the absolute number of early-onset cancer deaths in 2019 (`r prettyNum(mortalidad_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) and comparing it with the 1999 number (`r prettyNum(mortalidad_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`).

If you calculate the increase, it gives you a `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1)(mortalidad_2019/mortalidad_99 - 1)` = `r prettyNum(mortalidad_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` / `r prettyNum(mortalidad_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`.

## Context

The human population grew quite a bit in the last 30 years. According to [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/), it was `r prettyNum(poblacion_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` in 1999 and increased to (`r prettyNum(poblacion_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) in 2019. That is a `r scales::label_percent()(poblacion_2019/poblacion_99 -1)` increase.

Something I do not understand well is that in the paper, the authors talk about incidence, which is usually defined as a ["measure of the probability of occurrence of a given medical condition in a population within a specified period of time"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)), but give an absolute number: "In 2019, the incidence number of early-onset cancer was 3.26 million, (...)".

## Redoing the calculations

Instead of the absolute numbers, how many people got or died of an early-onset cancer, we can normalize those numbers, and make them relative to the population at that point in time.

### Indicence

For 2019, dividing the incidence number (`r prettyNum(incidencia_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) and dividing by population (`r prettyNum(poblacion_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) gives us `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.001)(incidencia_2019/poblacion_2019)`. This is the % of the population with an early-onset cancer diagnosis in 2019.

For 1999, dividing the incidence number (`r prettyNum(incidencia_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) and dividing by population (`r prettyNum(poblacion_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) gives us `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.001)(incidencia_99/poblacion_99)`. This is the % of the population with an early-onset cancer diagnosis in 1999.

Finally, if you calculate the increase: (`r prettyNum((incidencia_2019/poblacion_2019), big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` / `r prettyNum((incidencia_99/poblacion_99), big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`), we get a `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.001)(cambio_incidencia - 1)`. This is an increase of 22.5% in 'incidence' between 1999 and 2019.

### Mortality

For 2019, dividing the mortality number (`r prettyNum(mortalidad_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) and dividing by population (`r prettyNum(poblacion_2019, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) gives us `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.001)(mortalidad_2019/poblacion_2019)`. This is the % of the population that died of an early-onset cancer in 2019.

For 1999, dividing the mortality number (`r prettyNum(mortalidad_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) and dividing by population (`r prettyNum(poblacion_99, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`) gives us `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.001)(mortalidad_99/poblacion_99)`. This is the % of the population that died of an early-onset cancer in 1999.

If you calculate the increase: `r prettyNum((mortalidad_2019/poblacion_2019), big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` / `r prettyNum((mortalidad_99/poblacion_99), big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` , we get a `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.001)(cambio_mortalidad - 1)` . This is a **reduction** of 12% in mortality between 1999 and 2019.

## Conclussions

First of all, I might be missunderstaing something or making a mistake here. I would be very happy to correct it.

Assuming the logic above is reasonable, we go from the reported 79% increase in 'incidence' to an increase of `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(cambio_incidencia - 1)`. This is way easier to explain in terms of improvements in the medical tests, screening programs, etc.

For deaths, we go from the reported 27% increase to a **decrease** of `r scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(cambio_mortalidad - 1)`. This is also makes more sense given all the medical advances in detection and treatment of the last 30 years.
