<p>A recent <a href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049">BMJ Oncology paper</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="zhao2023b">(Zhao et al. 2023)</span> reported that “Global incidence of early-onset cancer increased by 79.1% and the number of early-onset cancer deaths increased by 27.7% between 1990 and 2019.”.</p>
<p>Those are stagering numbers, so let’s take a look at how they make their calculations.</p>
<section id="incidence" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incidence">Incidence</h2>
<p>In page 3, they state: “In 2019, the incidence number of early-onset cancer was 3.26 million, a 79.1% increase from 1990”.</p>
<p>So, they are using the absolute number of early-onset cancers in 2019 (3,260,000) and comparing it with the 1999 number (1,821,229).</p>
<p>If you calculate the increase, it really gives you a 79% = 3,260,000 / 1,821,229.</p>
</section>
<section id="deaths" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deaths">Deaths</h2>
<p>Also in page 3: “Besides, the number of early-onset cancer deaths in 2019 was 1.06 million, which was an increase of 27.7% from 1990”.</p>
<p>Again, they are using the absolute number of early-onset cancer deaths in 2019 (1,060,000) and comparing it with the 1999 number (830,070).</p>
<p>If you calculate the increase, it gives you a 28% = 1,060,000 / 830,070.</p>
</section>
<section id="context" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The human population grew quite a bit in the last 30 years. According to <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/">worldometers</a>, it was 5,316,175,862 in 1999 and increased to (7,764,951,032) in 2019. That is a 46% increase.</p>
<p>Something I do not understand well is that in the paper, the authors talk about incidence, which is usually defined as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)">“measure of the probability of occurrence of a given medical condition in a population within a specified period of time”</a>, but give an absolute number: “In 2019, the incidence number of early-onset cancer was 3.26 million, (…)”.</p>
</section>
<section id="redoing-the-calculations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="redoing-the-calculations">Redoing the calculations</h2>
<p>Instead of the absolute numbers, how many people got or died of an early-onset cancer, we can normalize those numbers, and make them relative to the population at that point in time.</p>
<section id="indicence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="indicence">Indicence</h3>
<p>For 2019, dividing the incidence number (3,260,000) and dividing by population (7,764,951,032) gives us 0.042%. This is the % of the population with an early-onset cancer diagnosis in 2019.</p>
<p>For 1999, dividing the incidence number (1,821,229) and dividing by population (5,316,175,862) gives us 0.034%. This is the % of the population with an early-onset cancer diagnosis in 1999.</p>
<p>Finally, if you calculate the increase: (0.0004198352 / 0.0003425825), we get a 22.550%. This is an increase of 22.5% in ‘incidence’ between 1999 and 2019.</p>
</section>
<section id="mortality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mortality">Mortality</h3>
<p>For 2019, dividing the mortality number (1,060,000) and dividing by population (7,764,951,032) gives us 0.014%. This is the % of the population that died of an early-onset cancer in 2019.</p>
<p>For 1999, dividing the mortality number (830,070) and dividing by population (5,316,175,862) gives us 0.016%. This is the % of the population that died of an early-onset cancer in 1999.</p>
<p>If you calculate the increase: 0.0001365108 / 0.0001561404 , we get a -12.572% . This is a <strong>reduction</strong> of 12% in mortality between 1999 and 2019.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclussions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclussions">Conclussions</h2>
<p>First of all, I might be missunderstaing something or making a mistake here. I would be very happy to correct it.</p>
<p>Assuming the logic above is reasonable, we go from the reported 79% increase in ‘incidence’ to an increase of 22.6%. This is way easier to explain in terms of improvements in the medical tests, screening programs, etc.</p>
<p>For deaths, we go from the reported 27% increase to a <strong>decrease</strong> of -12.6%. This is also makes more sense given all the medical advances in detection and treatment of the last 30 years.</p>

<p><code>jsPsychR</code> is a group of <strong>open source</strong> tools to help create experimental paradigms with <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/">jsPsych</a>, simulate participants and standardize the data preparation and analysis. The final goal is to help you have the data preparation and analysis ready before collecting any real data, drastically reducing errors in your protocols, and making the move towards registered reports easier.</p>

<section id="intro" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intro">Reproducible experiments</h2>
<p>We use different technologies to develop experiments. Some examples are <a href="https://www.psychopy.org/">Psychopy</a>, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>, <a href="https://www.limesurvey.org/">Limesurvey</a>, <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/jspsych-preload/">jsPsych</a>, <a href="https://gorilla.sc/">Gorilla</a>, etc. Each of these has advantages and disadvantages and, in general, there are pragmatic aspects to take into account when adopting one or the other: cost, type of experiment (EEG or behavioral, lab or online), lab history and available resources, …</p>
<p>In our lab, we opted for <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/">jsPsych</a> to run behavioral experiments because it is an <strong>open source</strong> javascript library, based on standard web technologies, and can be used online and offline.</p>
<p>In the last years, we started working on a set of tools to help people without coding expertise to create <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/">jsPsych</a> experimental protocols (<a href="https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychMaker">jsPsychMaker</a>), simulate participants (<a href="https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychMonkeys">jspsychMonkeys</a>) and standardize and automatize the data preparation and analysis (<a href="https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychHelpeR">jsPsychHelpeR</a>).</p>
<p>Our final goal is to have a big catalog of tasks available to use in the <a href="https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychMaker">jsPsychMaker</a> repo. Each of the tasks should run with <a href="https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychMonkeys">jspsychMonkeys</a> to create virtual participants. And each task will have a sister script in <a href="https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychHelpeR">jsPsychHelpeR</a> to fully automate data preparation (re-coding, reversing items, calculating dimensions, etc.).</p>
</section>
<section id="open-and-reproducible-pipeline" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="open-and-reproducible-pipeline">Open and reproducible pipeline</h2>
<p>To replicate an experimental protocol from a publication is not trivial. <span class="citation" data-cites="obels2020ampps">Obels et al. (2020)</span> checked the computational reproducibility of Registered Reports in Psychology. From 62 articles meeting the inclusion criteria, only 21 had both data and code, and could be computationally reproduced. One of the main goals of jsPsychR is to be able to create, share and reproduce an experiment, its data, and data preparation and analysis without any extra effort. If recent calls for Journals to assess computational reproducibility are successful <span class="citation" data-cites="lindsay2023m">(Lindsay 2023)</span>, this should be an unavoidable aspect of researcher’s work soon enough.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the components of the pipeline are be Open Source, which allows reviewers, collaborators, etc. to check and run the code. This also makes it accessible to anyone with a computer connected to the internet, eliminating cost constrains.</p>
<p>With this system you can create a paradigm, simulate data and prepare data and analysis almost automatically.</p>
<p>The system output is standardized, so names of variables and the structure of the data are predictable. Finally, the plots, tables, reports and analysis are reproducible, so you can get everything ready with simulated data, preregister or even better, go for a <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports">registered report</a> and just relaunch the data preparation and analysis when the participant’s responses arrive, with a single command.</p>
<p>And if you want to share the final data preparation and analysis project in a Docker container to make sure the future generations will be able to run it without dependency issues, <a href="05-jsPsychHelpeR.html#docker-containers">we got you covered</a>.</p>
